Updates:
--------
    - nMOLDYN compatible with Scientific >= 2.8.0

    - recomputed the fwhm_e for a correct comparison with nMOLDYN2.2.5
    - some preferences variables removed
    - no need to declare a path for acrobat reader on MacOS

    - simplified the PREFERENCES (not use singleton class anymore)
    - added a PREFERENCE to select which DB to use (MMTK or nMOLDYN)
    - GlobalMotionFilteredTrajectory: added the "target" parameter used to store in output a selection different from the one used to perform the global motion filtering
    - the nMOLDYN analysis input script used for a parallel cluster run can be launched with the taskname as argument
    - Materials Studio converters: the atoms are stored by block molecules with ascending xtd index order.
    - cythonized the pyx files and the setup.py
    - modified the setup script to suit for a Windows-64 bit build.
    - moved out the test trajectories from the nMOLDYN/Tests directory to the nMOLDYN/Trajectories directory

######################################################################

3.0.5:
======
    
Bug fixes:
----------
    - The acroread_path configuration variable at start up was not set correctly on Windows
    - Wrong formula implemented in PairDistributionFunction
    - Smoothed Static Coherent Structur Factor analysis could not be launched
    - Launching nMOLDYN on command-line using a script with -i options did not work properly
    - When setting up the logfile, it was always put in the default location whatever the preferences values.
    - When performing an analysis benchmark, when several test sets was run on a row, displaying the contents of a successful of
      failed test of one of the test set always displayed the one of the last set.
    - The group selection dialog was buggy
    - The Reorientational Correlation Function was not properly normalized
    - The Forcite trajectory converter did not work from the GUI

    - Parallelization is fully supported on Windows, Linux and hopefully Mac
    - The Radial Distribution analysis has been renamed PairDistributionFunction
    - Adding of DensityFunction calculation in PairDistributionFunction analysis
    - Removed the "Check job status" onglet. It was not useful anymore because it
      was redundant with the message displayed on the console and the logfile.
      Moreover, it was not user-friendly to have to open a new nMOLDYN instance
      to check for a running analysis o another instance ...
    - Reintroduced the xrange and yrange settings in the plotting interface
    - Some improvments in the Export plot functionnality
    - Updated and refreshed the API (still many things to do here)
    - Partial terms for msd, vacf and dos in cluded
    - Internal code reorganization: Chemistry and Mathematics modules created.
    - Back converter from NetCDF to VASP CONTCAR and XDATCAR
    - New Windows installer
    - nMOLDYN icon for windows version
    - New version checker available in command-line and from the GUI.
    - The CHANGELOG can be read from the GUI by settings in the preferences 
      the path to a text editor

To do:
------
    - New NetCDF plotter:
          * several plots displayable
          * do not use Tkagg anymore
          * superplot button within a 2D plot
          * Dialog with the variables name (+ None) and the settings
    - Correct the paths that are not properly set with os.normpath
    - Case of the paths defined in the preferences that does not exist
      (e.g. PREFERENCES.outputfilepath triggers a crash at the end of 
      the analysis if it does not exist)
    - Create Write_Output_File_Header

      different level in a molecule (e.g. for a protein: atom->chemical fragment->residue
      ->chain->protein)
    - DL_POLY trajectory conveerter: the keywords can now be in lower or upper case
    - Added spatial density analysis (currently very slow)
    - A version controller was implemented to check whether a nMOLDYN script is launched using
      a newer version of nMOLDYN. This may trigger some conflicts when parsing some parameters
      that have changed slightly.
    - Added stability tests for AVACF, ISFG, EISF and ARA analysis

          * Tix.Meter --> TK.Scale
          * Tix.NoteBook --> set of radiobuttons
